[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/mky0w5i4cbh0d1w1?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/barkz/powershell-toolkit-v2-8-430)<br>

This version of the Pure Storage PowerShell Toolkit has been deprecated. The new version that should be used is the Pure Storage PowerShell SDK that can be downloaded from the Pure1 Community at http://community.purestorage.com/t5/Interoperability-Best-Practice/Programming-Interfaces-Community-Page/ta-p/5788. 

The 2.8.0.430 version of the Toolkit is provided here as an example of how to use the Pure Storage REST API with Windows PowerShell. It also serves as a historical reference for how Pure Storage started our integration work with Windows PowerShell.
